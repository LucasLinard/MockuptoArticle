    I learned how to create a simple html page from zero using a text editor
    The tags are simple and easy to remember.
    I'm used to editing code on IDEs with syntax highlighting and autocompletion and I miss that.
    Solve one problem at a time. Small problems first. For example. First add the headers (h1, h2). It makes it
    easyer to see the rest of the text.
